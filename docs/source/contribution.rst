Documentation
--------------
This documentation is written in restructured text and its build using sphinx and the read the docs theme. The source can be found in our main repository in the ``docs/`` subfolder (https://github.com/Lan2Play/eventula-manager/tree/master/src).
Feel free to PR corrections or expansions of the documentation at any time! 

To build the documentation locally to the ``docs/build`` subfolder you have two options:

- Building with docker and the make file (recommended)
- Building with docker
- Building manually with the sphinx make file

Building with docker and the make file
.......................................

Makefile & docker - Windows
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Prereqirements: 

- Docker for Windows with wsl2 backend (https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/ Follow the Prerequisites, the Download and the Install part!)


 .. warning::

        If you are using git, consider cloning the repository within your wsl distro instead of with git for windows to get around line ending problems!

To build the documentation just enter yor wsl2 distribution and follow the Linux part below!


Makefile & docker  -Linux
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Prereqirements: 

- Docker (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)

Localisation
-------------
We try to implement the software and the documentation localable, but we currently can only do german and english translations, therefore any help is appreciated!

Eventula localisation

translation status
'''''''''''''''''''''
.. image:: https://translate.lan2play.de/widgets/eventula-manager/-/multi-auto.svg
    :alt: Translation status
    :target: https://translate.lan2play.de/engage/eventula-manager/

translate with weblate
'''''''''''''''''''''''

You can find the client translation on our `Weblate project`_

.. _Weblate project: https://translate.lan2play.de/engage/eventula-manager/


translate without weblate 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

You can find the localisation files in ``src/resources/lang/``. If you want to fix mistakes, you can find the files for every translated language in the corresponding subfolder.
If you want to add a whole language, copy the whole en folder and rename it to the Language code you want to add. The language files are Key - Value pair files, just edit the Value in there.

The localisations could be accessed in the PHP code with (example whoeweare from src/resources/lang/de/about.php):

.. code-block:: php

    __('about.whoeweare')

or within blade files (Views):

.. code-block:: php

    @lang('about.whoeweare')



Code
-----
If you want to get into coding for eventula, check out the :ref:`dev/getting_started:Getting Started` developer documentation, there you can find an introduction into how to setup your development environment and some specific parts of eventula where we would love to see adaption for more usecases.

Some things you should think of before starting out implementing new features:

- Can another feature thats already implemented be expanded? yes? then go for that instead of Building complete new stuff!
- Does the addition / change might affect other usecases than your own? Build your changes with legacy support in mind!
- Try to follow the coding Style which is used within eventula, just look around in our features to see which case is handled mostly in which manner
- Have i started an issue to announce that im working on a feature/change to get thoughts from the other developers and to prevent incompatibillities? No? Go for it! :)
- Why i shouldn't join the eventula discord developer channel for discussion?  

Before you want to PR changes you should ask yourself some questions:

- Have i tried to update a running version from eventula with data to the one with my changes? Are the changes update proof?
- Have i implemented all strings with localised variables? See Localisation!
- Have i changed the documentation (at least the english on!) on the affected parts?
- Have i changed the readme.md on the affected parts?

.. note::
   Please open your pull requests against our ``dev`` branch. 
   We will not merge to master directly!
