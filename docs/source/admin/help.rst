Help System
==================================================
You can create help articles which will be shown on the help page of eventula.
Also you can add files to the articles (and images via the wysiwyg editor).
The help feature is an optional system in eventula, so you have to enable it in order to use it.

The Help page will look something like this (users can also search here):

.. image:: ../images/help_13.png

   :align: center

if a user expands one article with attachments by clicking on it:

if a user expands one article without attachments by clicking on it:
