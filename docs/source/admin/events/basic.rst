Events
==================================================

One of the main features of eventula is event management (like the name could already indicate, lol).
If you went over to your admin panel you will see the event section on the left, there should be one test event already created.
Lets get into how to delete it and how to create new events.

Basic
-----

Delete an Event
...............

To delete the sample event (or any event in the future) just click on Delete right next to it:

.. image:: ../../images/event_delete_01.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: eventula event deletion
   :align: center

you will be asked to confirm the deletion.

.. warning::

        Once you deleted an event all the associated data is gone! This includes all Ticket information and all tournaments. Please think about making regular backups of your database!


Create an Event
...............

.. warning::

       Before you Create an Event you might want to jump to the Venues Documentation and create a new Venue before the Event! 

.. warning::

       Once an event is created you cant change the associated venue! 

On the right side you cann Add new events:

.. image:: ../../images/event_create_01.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: eventula event creation
   :align: center

You have to fill everything except the Essential info and the Event Live info here to create the Event.

The short description shows up on the home Page , as well as the essential info:

.. image:: ../../images/home_01.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: eventula home page
   :align: center



Both also will be shown on the ``events/`` page of your manager:

.. image:: ../../images/event_list_01.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: eventula event listing
   :align: center

On the events information page the short and the long description will be listed:

.. image:: ../../images/event_page_01.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: eventula event page
   :align: center

Eventula supports a different home page for paritipants of onging events, which is displayed either after they have been checked in (see Attandees Documentation) or if the event is marked as an online event and the start time is reached.
It will look something like that:

.. image:: ../../images/event_live_02.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: eventula event creation
   :align: center



The Online event setting is to control the sign up policy for the tournaments  and the redirection to the events live homepage for attandees once the event is live.
If you dont enable online event, you have to check in all attandees before they are redirected to the events live page and before they can register for tournaments.
If you enable Online Event the tournament registration can be done immediatly after a Ticket for the event is bought and the redirection to the events live page is only based on the starting time of the event. 

.. warning::
    Also you can currently not use gifted tickets in the Online Event and you should limit the Ticket count to 1 in your Tickets for Online events (see Tickets documentation)! Otherwise there will be problems when attandees with multible tickets triyng to join a tournament.

The allow Spectators option is only suitable for presence events, it allows you to create seperate spectator tickets that are optionally not seatable (see Tickets documentatin).

The Show Matchmaking feature allows you to show the Matchmaking feature embedded in youre event live page. You can alternatively enable a link in the global Navigation that is usable for all registered users, not only Event attendees (See Optional Systems Settings documentation)

If you created the event it will be in the Draft status, so only Administrators can see it. You have to set its status on published once you created all its nessecary content so Users and Guests can see it. This can be done on the Admin overview page of the event.

Editing an Event
.................
You can edit all your Event informations in the detailed event view when you click on it in the admin menu, all the following features can be reached here as well:

.. image:: ../../images/event_02.png

   :align: center

.. warning::
    If you edit the start / end time of your event and you have already created timeslots in one of your timetables, you have to check the validity of the entrys!



Event Announcements
--------------------
You can create, edit and delete Announcements on every event, wich will be displayed on the event live page, to get quick messages out to your attandees.

Seating
-------
Eventula can manage multiple seatingplans per event, so you can create your different arenas. Obviously the only make sense and are active on event which are not configured as online events (see Event creation)
you can create, edit and delete them in the Admin Panel in your Event if you click on ``View Seating Plans`` on the top.

.. image:: ../../images/event_seating_01.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: eventula event creation
   :align: center

after the creation you will see the drafted seatingplan and you could seat event attandees manually before the publication, but you have to set the status to published to ensure the attandees will be able to seat themselfes after buying a Ticket.

.. image:: ../../images/event_seating_02.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: eventula event creation
   :align: center

If you activate ``Lock Seating`` no more changes can be made by the users, even if the seatingplan is published.

The seatingplan will look something like this on the event Information page:

.. image:: ../../images/event_seating_03.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: eventula event creation
   :align: center

And something like this if you seated yourself:

   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: eventula event creation
   :align: center



Tournaments
-----------
Todo


Tickets
-------
If you change to the Tickets view, you can create different types of tickets (even free ones in combination with the free payment provider(see Payment Settings documentation)) 
and you can assign different users some free tickets or Admin tickets. You can see the assignment signed blue in the picture.

Note that Admin tickets cannot participate in tournaments!

.. image:: ../../images/event_tickets_01.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: eventula event creation
   :align: center

To add a Ticket type, fill at least the Ticket Name, Ticket Price (which as said can be 0), the Ticket Type (Participant or Spectator) and if the Ticket is seatable.

.. warning::
    If you are doing Online events dont use seatable Tickets and dont use Spectator tickets. Also Limit the No of Tickets per user to 1!

You can edit all these settings only  until the first kind of the Ticket is sold!

For showing how the purchasing process looks, i have created a Free Ticket with the Name Free ticket:
