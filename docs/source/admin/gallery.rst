(File)Gallery
==================================================

You can create gallerys which will be shown on the gallery page of eventula where you can add images and files.
Also you can link the gallery to an event.
The file upload feature is amongst other things nice to provide demos of your last tournament.
The gallery feature is an optional system in eventula, so you have to enable it in order to use it.

The Gallery in the frontend will look something like this:

Overview with example album without an event linked

.. image:: ../images/gallery_07.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: eventula event deletion
   :align: center

Overview with example album with an event linked

.. image:: ../images/gallery_11.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: eventula event deletion
   :align: center

If a user clicks on it it will look like this:

.. warning::

       Currently the images are not correctly thumbnailed in the detailed view. Issue: https://github.com/Lan2Play/eventula-manager/issues/155

Enable/Disable Gallery
----------------------
To use the Gallery system and enable the link in your top navigation you have to enable it.
You can either refer to the settings documentation or use the buttons direcctly on the ``Gallery`` site in your admin panel:

Enable:

   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: eventula event deletion
   :align: center

Disable:

.. image:: ../images/gallery_14.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: eventula event deletion
   :align: center



Add Album
-----------------
Lets create an Album! go to your Admin Panel to the ``Gallery`` Section and you can add your venue in the ``Add Album`` area.
You have to fill in a name and you can add a description if you want to.

.. image:: ../images/gallery_02.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: eventula event deletion
   :align: center


Press ``Submit`` to add the Album.

You will then be redirected to the detailed / editing /upload view.



Edit Album
-----------------
To enter the detailed / editing /upload view in the future, simply click ``Edit`` on the ``Albums`` list entry:

.. image:: ../images/gallery_05.png
   :scale: 50 %

   :align: center

in the ``Settings`` area you can edit your albums name and description, change the status (if you want to hide a specific Album from the public) and
link/ unlink an event to it.
Here is an example how you can link an event to your created Album:

.. image:: ../images/gallery_10.png
