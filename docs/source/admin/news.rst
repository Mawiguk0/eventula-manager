You can create News articles which will be shown on the home page of eventula and all users can add comments to the entrys.
Each comment has to be approved by an administrator and can be reported by users as well.


Add News article
-----------------

Lets create a News article! go to your Admin Panel to the ``News`` Section and you can Write your entry in the ``Post News`` area.
You have to fill everything, including tags:

   :align: center

Press ``Submit`` to add the entry.

Now it is visible on the Eventula home page:

Over the right you also get a list with all the comments users made on the article.


Moderating Comments

As mentioned before, comments can either be moderated in the News detail view via the homepage if you are logged in as an administrator:

   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: eventula event deletion
   :align: center

or you can see all unapproved / reported comments in your Admin panel:

   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: eventula event deletion
   :align: center


If a comment is already approved they will be visible to other users and the public.
It can be always reported by users in the frontend and you can delete them either in the frontend or in the Admin panel if you go to the ``Edit News Article`` view.
