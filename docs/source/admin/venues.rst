==================================================
You can create venues for your events so you dont need to enter the adress for every event.

Add Venue
-----------------

Lets create a Venue! go to your Admin Panel to the ``Venues`` Section and you can add your venue in the ``Add Venue`` area.

   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: eventula event deletion
   :align: center

Press ``Submit`` to add the venue.

You will then be redirected to the detailed / editing view.

The venue details will be shown on the events page when you associate the venue to the event (sample pictures from https://unsplash.com/ ):
